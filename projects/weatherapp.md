## What it does

This project displays a webpage.  It takes user input in the search bar, where the user searches for a location (city). The webpages accesses the accuweather API, then displays the weather information.  It also displays a picture based on the weather.
## How I built it
The project is built in React, using [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/home?workspace=422c114c-9928-4dd9-a348-c1241a436ec4).  This was my first project using React and javascript.

## Challenge I ran into

The challenge that I ran into, and could work on further, is how the webpage looks.  I had not learned proper styling yet, and it shows.  I may go and restyle the project in the future.
