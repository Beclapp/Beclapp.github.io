## What it does

This project displays movie ratings data in a bar graph.  The highest rated movie in the list will be displayed in red, rather than a gray color.  The project also takes user input from the console to add movies to the comparison.

## How I built it

This project is done in python, using plotly to graph the data.  The data comes from TMDb (The Movie Database), where movie codes from the script, as well as from the user, will be requested.
## Challenge I ran into

The main challenges came from the API.  Movie titles cannot be looked up, but rather IMDB movie codes.  This means that the user input is not very intuitive, and is not easily scaled up.
