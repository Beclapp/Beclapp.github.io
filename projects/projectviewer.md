## Inspiration
This is the biggest of my current projects.  Currently in progress and built for my Mother, who has a sewing small business.
## What it does
This mobile app allows the user to view a directory of customers, as well as a collection of projects.  The projects, which are added by the user, keeps track of sewing materials and prices of those materials.  Projects can also be staged as in progress or completed.
## How I built it
Built using [expo.io](https://expo.io/).  I have yet to connect the data to a DB, as I am still working on front end and logic.
## Challenge I ran into
This is my first mobile project, so I have had to learn more about React Native while working, but I have not yet run into any major challenges.
