## What it does
Full Stack Project that takes user input for a stock symbol.  The price is searched and displayed in a list to the user, which is updated in real time.  The user can see their full portfolio value.
## How I built it
Built through React.js in the front-end and Node.js in the backend.  There's a server and client component, where the client contacts the server and the server makes the API calls to gather stock prices.
